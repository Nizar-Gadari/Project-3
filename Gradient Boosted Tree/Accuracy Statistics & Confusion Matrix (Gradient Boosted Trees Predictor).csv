The prediction model achieved an overall accuracy of 68.8% with a Cohenâ€™s kappa of 0.365, indicating fair agreement beyond chance. Performance is stronger for Class 1, with a recall of 76.2% and F-measure of 0.725, compared to Class 0 with a recall of 60% and F-measure of 0.638. The model tends to misclassify Class 0 as Class 1 more often, suggesting a bias toward predicting Class 1
