The Gradient Boosted Tree model achieved the best overall accuracy of 68.8% (a bit under the optimal 70% accuracy percentage for lack of independent variables) out of the 
other three models, with a Cohenâ€™s kappa of 0.365, indicating fair agreement beyond chance. Performance is stronger for Class 1, with a recall of 76.2% and F-measure of 
0.725, compared to Class 0 with a recall of 60% and F-measure of 0.638. The model tends to misclassify Class 0 as Class 1 more often, suggesting a bias toward 
predicting Class 1
